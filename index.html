	<h2><b>"The dark side of the honeymoon": retracing rose breeding during the 19th - Preprint (June 2023)</b><br /></h2>

	In this preprint, we retraced the history of rose breeding during the 19th century, the golden age for roses in Europe! We indeed collected large phenotypic and genetic data from 200+ roses from an ancient collection and explored changes. Roses represent an ideal model to reconstruct the past history of breeding because they are reproduced through vegetative culture, allowing the maintenance of ancient varieties. This allows the genotyping and phenotyping of roses that were bred at different periods of time. We studied ~30 traits, including some presumably crucial for rose breeding: the duration of the blooming season, the color and number of petals and the floral scent (with volatile compounds quantified using a GC-mass spectrometry strategy). We have particularly studied wthe population structure, kinship and footprints of artificial selection, identifying genomic regions targeted by breeders. Finally, we performed a large GWA study considering both the genotypes and the phenotypes of the 200+ roses, generating the largest GWAS catalog for roses to date (https://roseGWASbrowser.github.io). Our main take home message is associated with the crucial importance of preserving botanical and ancient rose collections to safeguard diversity and ensure a sustainable breeding for the long-term. This requires an increasing effort, especially regarding state funding. <br /><br />

	<h2><b>Investigating genomic landscapes as a progression through time - Molecular Ecology (June 2023)</b><br /></h2>		
	<p style="margin: 10px 15px 15px 10px;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;"><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="img/molecolhuiying.png" width="400" />
	Using a large population-based whole-genome sequencing effort (8 Populus species, >200 individuals in total), we investigated genomic landscapes of nucleotide diversity and divergence. Thanks to this multispecies sampling, we were able to investigate the genomic landscapes as progression through time considering all the species pairs along the Populus divergence gradient. We observed relatively conserved patterns of genomic divergence across the species pairs and found support for predominant signatures of linked selection, independently of the stage across the divergence gradient. Our results are also consistent with additional contribution of gene flow and standing genetic variation in shaping these genomic landscapes. Our study highlights the importance of investigating genomic patterns on multiple species across a divergence gradient to learn more about speciation processes. Remarkable work by Huiying Shang (PhD initially supervised by Christian Lexer, and then by Ovidiu Paun and I). The paper is dedicated to the memory of Christian. <br /><br />

	<h1>About me</h1>
          <div class="contentText">
            <p>
	I am a population geneticist, employed as permanent researcher (CRCN) at INRAE, Toulouse, France. My research is focused on the study of evolutionary forces: gene flow, drift, mutation and selection and their relative importance in divergence and speciation. My main model is honey bees but I continue to work on some other models through collaborations, including some models I studied over the last decade (plants: oaks, cereals, Populus, Bromeliads etc; animals: passerine birds, salmon etc). My interests also include genomics - in its broader sense - and statistical methods for population genetics. <br />
